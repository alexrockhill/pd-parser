Find Photodiode Events
======================
In this example, we use ``pd-parser`` to find photodiode events and
align them to behavior. Then, we save the data to BIDS format.

Simulate data and use it to make a raw object:

We'll make an `mne.io.Raw object` so that we can save out some random
data with a photodiode event channel in it in `fif` format (a commonly used
electrophysiology data format).

Make behavior data:

We'll make a dictionary with lists for the events that are time-stamped when
the photodiode was turned on and other events relative to those events.
We'll add some noise to the time-stamps so that we can see how behavior
might look in an experimental setting.
Let's make a task where there is a fixation stimulus, then a go cue,
and a then response as an example.

Use the interactive graphical user interface (GUI) to find parameters:

On the documentation webpage, this is example is not interactive,
but if you download it as a jupyter notebook and run it or copy the code
into a console running python (ipython recommended), you can see how to
interact with the photodiode data to pick reasonable parameters by
following the instructions.

Find the photodiode events relative to the behavioral timing of interest:

This function will use the default parameters or the parameters you
found from :func:`pd_parser.find_pd_parameters` to find and align the
photodiode events, excluding events that were off because the computer
hung up on computation, for instance. That data is saved in the same folder
as the raw file (in this case, a temperary directory generated by
:func:`_TempDir`). The data can be used directly, or it can be accessed via
:func:`pd_parser.pd_parser_save_to_bids` to store it in the brain imagine
data structure (BIDS) standardized format before using it.

Add events relative to the photodiode events:

The photodiode is usually sychronized to one event (e.g. the fixation
so that if the deflections caused by the photodiode are large enough
to influence other channels through amplifier interactions it doesn't
cause issues with the analysis) so often the events of interest are
relative to the photodiode event. In the task a timer can be started at the
photodiode event and checked each time a subsequent event occurs.
These events should then be recorded in tsv file, which can be passed to
``pd-parser`` in order to add the events.
Note: if more than one photodiode event is used, the parser can be
used for each event separately using the keyword `add_event=True`.

Save data to BIDS format:

This saves our data to BIDS format so that it's ready to be analyzed in a
reproducible way; BIDS requires all the files the BIDS community has deemed
necessary for analysis, so you should have everything you need to continue
on with an analysis at this point. See https://bids.neuroimaging.io/ and
https://mne.tools/mne-bids/ for more information about BIDS.
