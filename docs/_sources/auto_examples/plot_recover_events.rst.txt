==================================================
Manually Recover Events Not Found by the Algorithm
==================================================
In this example, we use ``pd-parser`` to find photodiode events that
have corrupted pre-event baselines, photodiode plateaus or post-event
baselines but not corrupted onsets or offsets.
Note that it might be a good idea not to recover these events
as there might be noise in the data around this time.

Simulate data and use it to make a raw object

We'll make an `mne.io.Raw` object so that we can save out some random
data with a photodiode event channel in it in fif format (a commonly used
electrophysiology data format).

Find the photodiode events relative to the behavioral timing of interest

This function will use the default parameters to find and align the
photodiode events, recovering the events that we just corrupted.

Note that the mock function mocks user input so when you run the example,
you want to delete that line and unindent the next line, and then provide
your own input depending on whether you want to keep the events or not.

Find cessations of the photodiode deflections

Since we manually intervened for the onsets, on those same trials, we'll
have to manually intervene for the offsets.

On the documentation webpage, this is example is not interactive,
but if you download it as a jupyter notebook and run it or copy the code
into a console running python (ipython recommended), you can see how to
interact with the window to accept or reject the recovered events by
following the instructions.
